      "Central Bank of Armenia to send legislative initiative on cryptocurrencies to parliament",
    des: "Later this year or early next year the Central Bank of Armenia is likely to send a legislative initiative on cryptocurrencies to the National Assembly for discussions.",
    text: `YEREVAN, November 1. /ARKA/. Later this year or early next year the Central Bank of Armenia is likely to send a legislative initiative on cryptocurrencies to the National Assembly for discussions.
    The head of the regulator Martin Galstyan noted on Tuesday in response to a question of ARKA news agency that the initiative is still being discussed with relevant structures. He refrained from providing more details.
    Speaking at a parliamentary discussion on Armenia's draft state budget for 2024, Galstyan said that the initiative was drafted based on the best world experiences. He noted, however, that ‘one should not expect us to be extremely liberal."
    "We believe that this field should be regulated by the principle of 'one risk, one regulation'," he said.
    Galstyan added this year more than 10 specialists have been sent to Cambridge University to research the topic of cryptocurrencies.
    "The country must have the knowledge to be able to launch this industry. If it is left without informed approaches, the risks that can arise are huge. Therefore, we want to build knowledge first and then propose approaches," Galstyan explained. -0-`,

      "Unique agro-industrial complex Yeremyan Projects established with financial support of EDB in Armenian Tashir",
    des: `The official opening of Yeremyan Projects, the first world-class agro-industrial complex in Armenia's Tashir community in Lori province was held on October 28.`,
    text: `YEREVAN, October 30. /ARKA/. The official opening of Yeremyan Projects, the first world-class agro-industrial complex in Armenia's Tashir community in Lori province was held on October 28.
    The Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) had provided a $32 million loan for the project. The opening ceremony was attended by representatives of the Government of Armenia, EDB and other partner organizations, as well as members of the Yeremyan Projects team.
    The project is the first step in the implementation of the trilateral memorandum signed in August 2022 between the Government of Armenia, EDB and Yeremyan Farm. The purpose of the document is to ensure food security and sustainable economic development of Armenia.
    The agro-industrial complex allows for the creation of a vertically integrated enterprise ensuring the supply of high quality milk and raw meat for food production at Yeremyan Projects' own factories.
    The total budget of the project amounted to $43.5 million. With these funds, 300 hectares of arable land were purchased in Tashir community to build a modern cattle-breeding complex on 32 hectares in 14 months.
    The construction created additional jobs for the residents of the Lori region. The launch of the complex will create 120 new jobs. Comfortable working conditions meeting high requirements have been created, and recreation areas have been equipped. Training and briefing rooms, as well as conference halls have been also built.
    The agro-industrial complex with the capacity of 45 thousand liters of milk per day is designed for 1,500 cows. The complex consists of a barn, which has 2 buildings of cattle-breeding premises. High performance is achieved through the use of modern technologies, including an automatic carousel-type milking parlor, a feed mill and storage of feed mixtures.
    The pig farm, which is part of the complex is designed for keeping 580-600 sows, which allows producing up to 17,000 animals per year.
    At the same time, the construction of a plant for processing dairy and meat products is being completed in Yerevan.
    The investment program is being implemented with the support of the Government of Armenia, which partially subsidized the costs. --0--`,

    text: `YEREVAN, October 25. /ARKA/. Kilikia beer is created with the use of Armenian brewing traditions, the press service of Aсba Bank reports.
    At the Yerevan Brewery, which has a 70-year history, the quality depends on raw materials and technology; at the production facility that uses modern equipment almost all processes are automated. The company's laboratory controls the process: the beer undergoes all inspections before going on sale.
    The company’s production partner is Acba Leasing, which assisted the brewery to acquire European-manufactured equipment - from beer aging containers to refrigeration equipment and automatic flow lines.
    The brewery, which holds more than 50% of the local beer market, was able thanks to the new equipment, to increase output.
    ‘Kilikia beer is made by using classical technologies. We have preserved classical brewing technologies and Armenian traditions. Why do we use barley in making Kilikia beer? Because there are barley bran, which wheat does not have: these bran are the filtration surface," said Arayik Ghazaryan, head of production at Kilikia Brewery and chief technologist.
   "In order to keep up with the market we upgrade our equipment and get quality products. As a result of cooperation with Acba Leasing, we have acquired a Czech bottling machine with a capacity of 15,000 bottles per hour. This equipment works on exported products. Barrel washing machine was also purchased in cooperation with Acba Leasing, which is a great help in terms of time and quality," said Hayk Torosyan, Chief Engineer at Kilikia brewery.
    Kilikia beer is exported to Europe, USA, Russia and is competitive in the global market.`,
